## Overview
This R markdown contains the scripts used to generate Hi-C statistic figures in our work. All the sequencing data have been upload to GEO under accession number GSE183186 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183186). We also upload HiC matrix data as processed results that can be download from GEO.

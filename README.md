Analyses scripts for this project

---

## Overview
This R markdown contains the scripts used to generate Hi-C statistic figures in our work. All the sequencing data have been upload to GEO under accession number GSE183186 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183186). We also upload HiC matrix data as processed results that can be download from GEO. The processed input data used in this scripts were generated by HiC-Pro:
 - ".allValidPairs" files containing contact pairs. 
 - ".dis_int" files extracted chromosome distance and interaction pairs from ".allValidPairs" using a custom python  script.
 - "_abs.bed" files contain the chromatin bin information.
 - "_dense_iced.matrix" files were generated from "_iced.matrix" using sparseToDense.py provided by HiC-Pro.

## Overview
This R markdown contains the scripts used to generate Hi-C statistic figures in our work. All the sequencing data have been upload to GEO under accession number GSE183186 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183186). We also upload HiC matrix data as processed results that can be download from GEO.

## Abstract
**Background:** The ring-shaped cohesin complex is an important factor for the formation of chromatin loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) by loop extrusion. However, the regulation of association between cohesin and chromatin is poorly understood. In this study, we use super-resolution imaging to reveal the unique role of cohesin subunit RAD21 in cohesin loading and chromatin structure regulation.\
\
**Results:** We directly visualize that up-regulation of RAD21 leads to excessive chromatin loop extrusion into a vermicelli-like morphology with RAD21 clustered into foci and excessively loaded cohesin bow-tying a TAD to form a beads-on-a-string-type pattern. In contrast, up-regulation of the other four cohesin subunits results in even distributions. Mechanistically, we identify that the essential role of RAD21 is attributed to the RAD21-loader interaction, which facilitates the cohesin loading process rather than increasing the abundance of cohesin complex upon up-regulation of RAD21. Furthermore, Hi-C and genomic analysis reveal how RAD21 up-regulation affects genome-wide higher-order chromatin structure. Accumulated contacts are shown at TAD corners while inter-TAD interactions increase after vermicelli formation. Importantly, we find that in breast cancer cells, the expression of RAD21 is aberrantly high with poor patient survival and RAD21 forms beads in the nucleus. Up-regulated RAD21 in HeLa cells leads to compartment switching and up-regulation of cancer-related genes. \
\
**Conclusions:** Our results provide key insights into the molecular mechanism by which RAD21 facilitates the cohesin loading process and provide an explanation to how cohesin and loader work cooperatively to promote chromatin extrusion, which has important implications in construction of three-dimensional genome organization.
